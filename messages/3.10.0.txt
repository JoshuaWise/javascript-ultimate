JavaScript Ultimate now support ES2016!

You'll also notice a few features from ES2017, such as object spread/rest operators
and async/await functions.

NOTE:
If you use SublimeLinter, you'll need to add the following to your settings file:
(Preferences > Package Settings > SublimeLinter > Settings - User)
"syntax_map": {
  "javascript.dom": "javascript" 
}
