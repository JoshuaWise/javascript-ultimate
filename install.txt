JavaScript Ultimate is now installed!

If you have "Better JavaScript" installed, you need to uninstall that immediately,
or things won't work properly.

Regardless, you need to restart Sublime Text to finish installation.


Uninstalling
------------
Before uninstalling JavaScript Ultimate, be sure close all open JavaScript/JSON
files.

If you find yourself without JavaScript/JSON support, look into your User Settings, and remove "JavaScript" from the "ignored_packages" list. This should automatically happen if you remove JavaScript Ultimate through Package Control.

It's normal to see a few errors from Sublime about not being able to find syntax files. Just exit
Sublime and re-open it, and everything should be fixed.
