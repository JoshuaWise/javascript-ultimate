JavaScript Ultimate is now installed!

If you have "Better JavaScript" installed, you need to uninstall that immediately,
or things won't work properly.

Regardless, you need to restart Sublime Text to finish installation.


Uninstalling
------------
Before uninstalling JavaScript Ultimate, be sure close all open JavaScript/JSON
files. Then, look into your User Settings, and remove "JavaScript" from the "ignored_packages" list.
You can then safely uninstall JavaScript Ultimate.

It's normal to see a few errors from Sublime about not being able to find syntax files. Just exit Sublime and re-open it, and everything should be fixed.
