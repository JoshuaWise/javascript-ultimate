# JavaScript Ultimate

*(Language Package for Sublime Text 3)*

Although Sublime Text's built-in JavaScript language definition have made *significant* improvements recently, it's still not perfect. JavaScript Ultimate aims to be a perfectly accurate (to-the-spec) language definition for JavaScript.

Here are some of the improvements that it makes:
* More accurate to the JavaScript specification
* Complete ES2016 support
* JavaDoc support
* Context-awareness (capable of highlighting errors or mistakes in your code)

## Regular Expression comprehension

If you use JavaScript Ultimate with any of your existing themes, it will work just fine, and you can you enjoy a perfect JavaScript language definition.

But, if you use any of the themes that come with this bundle, you can the additional benefit of Regular Expression comprehension, as seen below:
